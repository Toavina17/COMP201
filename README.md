Assignment 1.2 (2022/23)

OBJECTIVE
This assignment is mainly about “design/implementation”. You should be implementing a simulation of part of the security system. This simulation will follow the requirements that have been defined incoursework 1 and follow the use cases that you defined. This simulation will not be a full implementation of the original requirement but only implement the card/code entry part of the system. For this case, there is no UI code required. You are strongly encouraged to start this work as soon as possible.
The purpose of this exercise is to understand the challenges of implementing a design from requirements and the state modelling required. This code will be implemented using a simulated version of the hardware, it would then be possible later to implement a security system by replacing the simulation code with software drivers connected to real hardware.
